# Beyblade Battle NFT Platform

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a Beyblade battle NFT platform using nested tokens within the Unique Network.

### Before we start

- Create a Substrate account
- Get `OPL` (testnet) tokens: https://t.me/unique2faucet_opal_bot
- Create `.env` from `.env-example` and set your mnemonic phrase
- Run `npm install`

## Legend

Let's dive into our exciting Beyblade battle NFT game! In this game, users can mint NFTs that represent powerful Beyblades. Each NFT starts with an empty battle recordâ€”no wins, no losses.



Players can then engage in thrilling Beyblade battles against each other. When a Beyblade wins a battle, its `Victories` counter increases. If it loses, the `Defeats` counter increments accordingly.



Epic achievements can be awarded as well, and these achievements are also NFTs owned by the original Beyblade NFTs!



### Talking about restrictions

- All Beyblade NFTs are owned by individual users
- The application can modify NFT properties (battle records, achievements)
- Users cannot directly modify the properties of their Beyblade NFTs

---

## 1. Create a Beyblade collection

```sh
node ./src/1-collection-beyblades.js
```

## 2. Create Achievements collection

```sh
node ./src/2-collection-achievement.js
```

## 3. Create at least two Beyblade NFTs

Pass the following arguments to the function
- collectionId (step 1)

- owner nickname

For example:

```sh
node ./src/3-create-beyblade.js 3135 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY BladeBreaker
node ./src/3-create-beyblade.js 3135 5CPuU98SimxwoHZRZCi8hezgnfBwATs8vKo6haqkaP3hUj7X SpinMaster
```

## 4. Battle!

Pass the following arguments to the function

- Achievements collectionId (step 2)
- First player's tokenId 
- Second player's tokenId

```sh
node ./src/4-battle.js 3132 3133 1 2
